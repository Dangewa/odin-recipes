            <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
            <li>finely chopped chives, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><strong>For the candied bacon</strong>
            <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon spice mix with salt, black pepper and garlic evenly</li>
            <li>6 slices bacon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make salmon: Preheat oven to 400°. Place lemon slices on bottom of 9"-x-13" baking dish and place salmon on top. Season salmon all over with 2 teaspoons McCormick Himalayan Pink Salt, Black Pepper and Garlic All-Purpose Seasoning.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together mustard, oil, lemon juice, maple syrup, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon McCormick Himalayan Pink Salt, Black Pepper and Garlic All-Purpose Seasoning. Pour sauce over salmon.</li>
            <li>Roast salmon until cooked through and it flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Turn oven to broil and broil until golden, if desired, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make candied bacon: In a small bowl, whisk maple syrup with brown sugar and ¼ teaspoon of McCormick Himalayan Pink Salt, Black Pepper and Garlic All-Purpose Seasoning.  In a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until lightly golden on both sides, about 4 minutes per side. Drain bacon fat.</li>
            <li>Return skillet to medium heat and pour maple syrup mixture into pan. Add bacon and cook, turning slices frequently until liquid is almost absorbed and bacon is glazed, 3 to 4 minutes. </li>
            <li>Using tongs, carefully transfer bacon to a work surface to cool completely. Crumble bacon and sprinkle with chives over cooked salmon before serving. </li>
        </ol>
